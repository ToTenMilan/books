    Construct your test environment carefully.
    Watch out for the “stubject.”
    Know the risks of partial doubles.
    Favor explicit dependency injection over more implicit techniques.
    Avoid faking an interface you don’t control.
    Look for high-fidelity fakes.
    Wrap third-party interfaces.
