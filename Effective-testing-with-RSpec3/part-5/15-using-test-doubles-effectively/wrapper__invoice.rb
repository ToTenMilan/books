# drawbacks:
# The Invoice class is tightly coupled to the TaxJar clientâ€™s object hierarch
# The complexity will make refactoring and maintenance more difficult



### Better approach
# we may write SalesTax wrapper to decouple Invoice from Taxjar
# we accept that underlying API may change, and only whis class would need to change then

  rescue Taxjar::Error::NotFound

# new Invoice, that needs wrapper of TaxJar instead of TaxJar itself
class Invoice
  def initialize(address, items, sales_tax: SalesTax.new)
    @address = address

    taxes = subtotal * tax_rate
    subtotal + taxes

    @sales_tax.rate_for(@address.zip)

# ... also specs are simpler
RSpec.describe Invoice do
  let(:address) { Address.new(zip: '90210') }

    invoice = Invoice.new(address, items, sales_tax: sales_tax)

    expect(invoice.calculate_total).to eq(109.50)
  end
end

# to detect changes in TaxJar API
RSpec.describe SalesTax do
  let(:sales_tax) { SalesTax.new }

  it 'can fetch the tax rate for a given zip' do
    rate = sales_tax.rate_for('90210')

  end

  it 'raises an error if the tax rate cannot be found' do
