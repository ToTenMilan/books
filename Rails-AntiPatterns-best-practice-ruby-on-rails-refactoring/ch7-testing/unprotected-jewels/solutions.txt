Good gem must be well tested
to test your gem:

1. Always aim to separate gem from rails and write only unit tests

2. If You need only the part of rails to test your gem, include only this part, not whole Rails

3. If your gem is exercising every part of Rails's MVC, you need to embed a Rails app in tests
