1. Build to scale from the start, when profits outweigh costs

2. Keep assets in public/system to not make them disappear, from deploy to deploy

3. Add indexes to all `_id` columns (before rails 5. In Rails 5 its made by default). Moreover:
  1. index columns that must have unique value per row
  2. index `type` column in STI models
  3. columns used in `where` clauses, that:
    contain only few string values
    partial index on boolean columns, on small number of values, i.e. 100000 true's and 1000 false's in column, so put index on false's
    on datetime columns, of its values are used in sorting

  NOTE: indexes slows down INSERT command. Add them only where they are needed
